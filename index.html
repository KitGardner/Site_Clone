          <p class="text-white"><strong>Adventurer's Emporium</strong> was founded in 1324 by the Great Mage Archemus
            who originally was just trying to lighten his bags from all of his travels. When checking the nearby
            competition for competitive pricing he noticed that adventurers were paying highway robbery! These people
            are risking thier lives and we rob them! Hmph! Wanting to strike it rich and help his fellow adventurers he
            began selling stock at more affordable rates and the business boomed from there! Archemus is always aiming
            to expand his stock and services. Rumor has it that plans are in motion to offer some more "Spicy" services
            for devoted customers. Ever tried covering mutton with dragon salt. Delicious!
